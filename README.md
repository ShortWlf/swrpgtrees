This mod streamlines tree chopping in Minecraft! Simply sneak and break the bottom log of a tree with an axe, and the entire tree will fall instantly. This dramatically speeds up resource gathering and makes clearing forests much more efficient. The mod is also highly configurable, allowing you to define which blocks are considered logs and leaves.

Features:

Instant Tree Felling: Break the bottom log of a tree while sneaking with an axe to fell the whole tree.   

Configurable Log and Leaf Blocks: Customize which blocks are recognized as logs and leaves via the config file. This allows compatibility with modded trees.
